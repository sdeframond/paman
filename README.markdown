Paman
=====

This is a dead simple wrapper around your usual package manager. I use it to keep trace of what I have installed.

Usage
=====

- Edit configuration in `conf.py`
- Launch with `paman.py edit` to edit the package list.
- Launch with `paman.py sync` to sync your package list with your package manager.

I use to make a link from somewhere in my `$PATH` to the `paman.py` file.
